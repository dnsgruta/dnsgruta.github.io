# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Denise Gruta and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Game Animation, but I have a minor in Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 Part 2: [Philosopher's Schedule](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-denise-and-joaquin/tree/main/part-2)
    In this lab, we were tasked to create a schedule where two philosophers could sleep, think, and eat but avoid having to socialize. I thought it was a fun hypothetical scenario to work on, and felt like a puzzle. This was the lab where for-loops started to click more for me; I also learned how to use a loop to check for repeating characters.

* Lab 4 Part 2: [Hi-Lo](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-denise-and-evan/tree/main/part-2)
    This lab was interesting because it was the first one where we had to come up with the entire algorithm ourselves. Looking back, it was relatively simple, but I remember feeling accomplished when I first did it. I learned how to do std::cin and std::cout during this lab.

* Lab 8 Part 1: [Command Line MadLib](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-denise-g/tree/main/part-1)
    Iâ€™ve always enjoyed playing mad libs, so this was a fun lab for me. It built upon our previous mad libs lab, except this time, the answers went into the command line. This was a good exercise in learning command line arguments and input validation.
